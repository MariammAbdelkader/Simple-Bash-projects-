#  Project 1: Random Quote Generator (Bash)

##  Overview
This is a simple **Bash script** that displays a **random motivational quote** each time it is executed.  
It’s a beginner-friendly project to help you practice arrays, random numbers, and basic Bash scripting concepts.

---

##  How It Works
- The script stores multiple quotes in a Bash array.
- Each time it runs, it picks a random index using the built-in `$RANDOM` variable.
- It prints the quote corresponding to that random index.

---

##  Concepts Used
- Arrays in Bash
- Arithmetic expansion `$(( ))`
- Random number generation with `$RANDOM`
- Echo command for printing output
- File permissions (`chmod +x`)
